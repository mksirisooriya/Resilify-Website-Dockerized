📌 Project Overview

This repository contains the Dockerized source code for the marketing website of Resilify. The workflow is designed for easy maintenance, scalability, and security:

1.  **Code Updates:**  The system automatically fetches changes from the frontend repositories at [https://github.com/KaveeshTennakoon/Resilify-Website](https://github.com/KaveeshTennakoon/Resilify-Website) and [https://github.com/Resilify/Marketing_Website](https://github.com/Resilify/Marketing_Website).
2.  **Automated Build and Push:** A GitHub Action then automatically builds a new Docker image and pushes it to Docker Hub.
3.  **Simplified Deployment:** The updated Docker image can then be redeployed from Portainer on the VPS, streamlining the deployment process.
4.  **Reverse Proxy with Nginx Proxy Manager:** Nginx Proxy Manager provides a user-friendly interface for managing reverse proxy configurations, SSL certificates, and domain mappings.

This approach guarantees a predictable, scalable, and secure deployment experience.
